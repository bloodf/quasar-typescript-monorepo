### Commit without validation
```
git commit -m "..." --no-verify
```

### Linking

When linking inside of the Monorepo, everything works as expected. If you are trying to consume packages from this Monorepo _in a different application_ locally, using `npm link` or `yarn link` [does not work as expected](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/5538). However, we have a workaround for the time being.

1. Run `yarn build`
2. Change the `package.json` of the consumer from `$YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME` (which lives inside the monorepo) to `file:./../monorepo/packages/$YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME`
3. Run `rm -rf node_modules && yarn` in the consumer
4. ðŸŽ‰
